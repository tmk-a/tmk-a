### üåø Tamaki Akita | Software Developer

I‚Äôm a full-stack developer based in Canada, with experience in large-scale web system development for the public sector in Japan.  
I build web applications that prioritize both clarity and feeling‚Äîtools that function smoothly and invite thoughtful interaction.

Over four years, I contributed to national systems ranging from health insurance platforms to data tools for research programs.  
That experience shaped how I approach code today: with structure, care, and attention to context.

Currently, I'm focusing on modern web development using React, TypeScript, and Node.js.  
I'm especially interested in how design, language, and logic can come together to shape digital experiences that feel intuitive, purposeful, and quietly expressive.
